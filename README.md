# XAVI DOMINGUEZ - FAB ACADEMY ASSIGNMENTS 2016
HOLA.
I'm multimedia engineer, graduated at La Salle Univeristy and FabAcademy 2016 graduated.
These are my assignments made at this intensive 6 month program called FAB ACADEMY ( http://fabacademy.org/about/ ).
It was an amazing experience where I've learnt (after hours and hours of personal work...) :
 
 1. How to use a Fab Labâ€™s digital fabrication tools for rapid prototyping like: 
  - Epilog Mini Lasercutter
  - Roland MDX-20 Milling Machine
  - 3D printer
  - Roland CAMM-1 Servo GX-24 Desktop Vinyl Cutter
  - ShopBot
  
2. Electronics design and production by producing circuit boards using a variety of sensors and output devices.
3. How to program AVR microcontrollers on the boards I've produced.
4. Molding and casting
5. 3D scanning and printing
